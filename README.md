My program is a CLI that allows for the creation and manipulation of a MaxHeap. MaxHeap.cpp is the max heap object,
with all the function used for the max heap, exchange and arraySizeIncrease were helper functions use to provide 
further code robustness. 

Assignments4.CPP is the main function that handles the execution and CLI of the program.
